##  CI for Homebrew appeal - [Attila](/people/attila-gyorffy)

http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/homebrew/brew-test-bot

The Homebrew community maintainers have started a Kickstarter campaign to cover the costs of a brew test-bot. Given that most contributions still have to be checked manually, acceptance is sometimes time consuming. The brew test-bot will be an automated review and testing system for the Homebrew OS X package manager to speed up handling community contributions. Sweet! The project is already funded, however if you feel like you could pledge a quid or two, please don't stop the funding. Imagine how much more we could do to make our favourite OS X package manager better...
