## Migrating live data is a pain, use this gem to make it simpler - [Tom Russell](https://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/tom-russell)
A [gem](https://github.com/ajvargo/data-migrate) by [Andrew J Vargo](https://github.com/ajvargo) that aims to make live data migrations less scary. Find it here: https://github.com/ajvargo/data-migrate

## A better Calendar for all - Francesca Granato

A note from Francesca : "I think the design is strong, the screen real estate is well-used, the UI is almost entirely gesture-based and the underlying premise of the app challenges the way we use calendars on our phones. Its worth checking out (although it isn't free). " 

This is an awesome app and we could gain a lot from looking at it's gesture based interface.

## Games on the web platform - [Henry Turner](https://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/henry-turner)

The web platform is becoming more and more powerful. [Artillery](http://blog.artillery.com/2013/09/project-atlas-and-the-artillery-platform.html) is a platform for the development of in-browser games.

## How many relations could an active record model have if an active record model could chuck wood? - [Jolyon Pawlyn](https://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/jolyon-pawlyn)

From Jolyon: "A second project had a requirement to display a most related models section, or even a third project if you count the 'Related Blog Posts' section on this site. A good candidate for a gem, so as a starter for 10 we have [most_related](https://github.com/jpawlyn/most_related)."
