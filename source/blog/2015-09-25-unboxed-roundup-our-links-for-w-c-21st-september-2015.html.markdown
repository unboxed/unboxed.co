## Installing web-apps in 2015 - [Murray S](/people/murray-steele)

http://eev.ee/blog/2015/09/17/the-sad-state-of-web-app-deployment/

This rant about installing a rails-based web-forum reminds me of [a similar post](https://www.dreamhost.com/blog/2008/01/07/how-ruby-on-rails-could-be-much-better/) from the early days of rails.  The result of the discussion started by that old post was that we got tools like [passenger](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/) that simplified deploying and managing rails applications.  Hopefully this new post will have a similar outcome and rally the community to develop new tools that make things easier again.

["So`ne Musik" by Deichkind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdIP3hyxi3k)

It’s hard to pick a favourite from Deichkind, a hip-hop/electro group from Hamburg. They’ve been around for almost 2 decades and have changed their style considerably over the years, starting as more traditional hip hop band, but have gone a lot more electronic in recent years (complete with Daft-Punk-ish outfits). They are known for the great live performances, including crazy outfit changes, spraying the audience with beer and vodka (and feathers?) and using inflatables to crowd surf. “Remmidemmi (Yippie Yippie Yeah)”, “Arbeit nervt” and “Leider geil” are also great!
