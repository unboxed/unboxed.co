A shorter than usual dev newsletter this week, in no way related to its coinciding with the Unboxed Christmas party.

## Fast Rails Tests Through Behavior Verification (Pawel)
A goodly amount of hints and tips about getting your Rails tests to run faster; mostly through changing the design of your code.

## A Ruby Design Process
Brian Ford aka brixen, one of the creators of [Rubinius](http://rubini.us) talks about his proposal for a Ruby design process. Well worth reading if you have the future of the language at heart.

## Elnode - an Emacs version of node.js (Matt F)

## Removal of `like` and `not_like` from Rails 4 (Murray)

As a follow up to [our previous newsletter](/blog/cucumbers-missed-high-fives-dancing-hungarians-and-more):

They've removed the like and not_like operators from Rails 4 because of <%= reasons %>.  Oh well.  There's always gems like [Squeel](https://github.com/ernie/squeel), shame we can't have a richer API exposed directly in ActiveRecord in core though (even if it is probably available by dropping down to Arel).
