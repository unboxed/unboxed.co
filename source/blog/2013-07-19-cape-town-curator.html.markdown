#### Audio components for Javascript 
When working with fully fledged audio software we often deal with multiple software instruments which can be used via a common interface with our audio software. I have been thinking a lot recently about an ecosystem of open source instruments being distributed around the internet with a common interface for working with audio processing in a browser environment. This week I found [component.fm](http://component.fm/) which is a library of different filters, oscillators and other audio components to use in your html5 audio apps. It's not quite Stienberg's VST (Virtual Studio Instruments) standard.... yet!
