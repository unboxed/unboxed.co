This week brought to you by Attila Györffy.

This week I'd like to start the newsletter by something fresh, somthing that is more of a set of eye candies, a set of experiments by front-end experts:

## Kontext

Here's an interesting concept of context switching: [Kontext](http://lab.hakim.se/kontext/) by Hakim El Hattab could be used in mobile interfaces or even to drive full screen presentations. Nice and fresh transitions driven by CSS3.

## 60fps mobile apps

Paul Lewis (of Google fame) has written up his findings on [how to produce 60 FPS mobile interfaces](http://aerotwist.com/blog/making-a-60fps-mobile-app/). Great read with a set of useful techniques you could apply to your next mobile-first application.

## Ghostlab: Synchronized mobile testing

Talking about the mobile first approach, we are currently working on something exciting that involves having to synchronize a huge number of mobile devices. To solve this problem, we've found '[Ghostlab](http://vanamco.com/ghostlab/)'.

Ghostlab synchronizes scrolls, clicks, reloads and form input across all connected clients. This means what you're testing is not the simple page load, but the full user experience. Spot on.

## The half-arsed Agile manifesto

And to include something for the ones who prefer the Agile-specific content:

Matt P has found an interesting article titled '[The half-arsed agile manifesto](http://www.halfarsedagilemanifesto.org)' that has clearly been written as a joke. Or is it genuine? See if you can decide.

Until next week's newsletter:

Have a great weekend everyone.
