[http://www.sitepoint.com/docker-for-rubyists/](http://www.sitepoint.com/docker-for-rubyists/)

Docker is a pretty awesome tool and one that I think will have a pretty big impact on how we do development. But, if you haven’t had much experience with Linux containers (or virtual machines), Docker’s underlying ideas as well as its benefits may be a little difficult to understand.

This article will give you an overview of what Docker is, how it works and a little bit about how it relates to Ruby/Rails.

So there is this new tool called Docker, and you may have heard great stories about it. But as a web developer using Ruby, you may wonder what this tool changes for you. Skeptical? Please follow [this way](http://blog.gemnasium.com/post/65599561888/rails-meets-docker)!

[http://andrew.ghost.io/emulating-node-js-modules-in-ruby/](http://andrew.ghost.io/emulating-node-js-modules-in-ruby/)

An interesting article on how to mimmic Node.js' module system. In Ruby, when you call require, all the code from the required file gets loaded into the global name space. This article explores how we could wrap modules like Node.js' closures in Ruby.
