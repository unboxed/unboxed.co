<h2 "View public profile"">Other insights shared:</h2>
* Interview people who give you the insights, the people who experience the problem that you think you’re going to solve
* Identify your assumptions, go out and talk to people
* Prepare for your interviews by knowing your goals ahead of time
* Encourage the end user to talk by using open-ended questions
* Measure the success of an interview by how much you’re listening and not talking – get the chance to hear what the end user has to say
* The key thing about hypothesis: You need to know what you’re looking for, what result will make it valid or invalid?
* Have minimum documentation – take the key pieces that people have strong opinions on, put these on paper, make any notes and share this with the team
* Keep iterating, keep revisiting – this will form a deep understanding of your customer and what’s of most value to them
* There is nothing that replaces hearing the problems you’re trying to solve than directly from the customer’s mouth
