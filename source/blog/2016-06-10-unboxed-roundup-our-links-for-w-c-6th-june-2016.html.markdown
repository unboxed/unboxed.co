## When Software has to fight against Human Nature - [Oskar Pearson](/people#oskar-pearson)

https://medium.com/@Timoth3y/why-i-turned-down-500k-pissed-off-my-investors-and-shut-down-my-startup-2645c4ca1354

This startup founder abandoned his apparently successful product idea. After receiving a series of tangential feature requests he realised his product had a fatal flaw: it would only show benefit to the customer in the long term. Additionally, the customer would need to do a significant amount of work before they got to see that benefit. Realising this was against human nature (see [https://badgeville.com/wiki/Gamification](Gamification)) he evaluated other options and then decided to move onto other products.

## Track of the Week - [Richard A](/people#richard-archer)

I'm sorry to say that track of the week is the nauseatingly punky 'Nelly the Elephant' by The Toy Dolls. Not only will it haunt the memories of University students the spent too much time at Cheesy Night in your local dive club back in the day, but it is the only song that currently puts my 4 month to sleep. It is therefore on constant play at home, and full-on earworm mode when I'm at work. If I have to suffer it, so do you.
...Kill me. Kill me now..
