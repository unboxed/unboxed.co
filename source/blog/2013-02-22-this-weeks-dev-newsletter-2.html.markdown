OpenHack - Murray
==
A new coding meetup for London - it's part of a global meetup idea called [openhack](http://openhack.github.com/).  The goal is to have meetings that are just focused on getting together to hack on code, open to all programmers regardless of ability or language preference.  The london organisaers are trying to gauge interest before having the first meeting, if it sounds like the kind of thing you'd be interested in follow [@OpenHackLDN](https://twitter.com/OpenHackLDN) and get involved.


Inside test frameworks - Murray
==
http://interblah.net/how-rspec-works & http://interblah.net/how-minitest-works

Two blog posts that go into great detail about what actually happens when you run your tests in minitest or rspec.  The author is writing his own testing framework, [kintama](http://interblah.net/kintama) and these posts are part of him exploring what he's done and explaining why his approach is different.  It's not about how the tests you write work (e.g. it's not about assert_blah vs. should blah() ), but more about how the frameworks actually end up running your tests, and what that means for the flexibility of the tests you write.
