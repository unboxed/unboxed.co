## Twine- Interactive Fiction Writer/Visualiser - [(Lizard)] (/people/elizabeth-curson)

http://gimcrackd.com/etc/src/

Possibly not of interest to anyone but me, but recently I've been playing with a tool called Twine- a tool which allows interactive fiction writers see a visual map of the story as they are writing and highlights broken links in your story so it is really easy to debug. It is a lot less heavy that tools like Inform (http://inform7.com/if/) as you are working with interactions as opposed to mapping out full objects and I am rather enjoying working with it.


##  IE VMs are Back - [(Murray)](/people/murray-steele)

http://www.modern.ie/virtualization-tools

MS are now providing VMs for all IE versions on various Windows versions (IE 6 on Win XP up to IE 10 on Win 8).  They used to do this a while ago, but they mysteriously stopped.  I think these are slightly better as they're for any host os and for OS X you get the choice of a virtualbox or vmware VM for download.

## Working with rescue… - [(Andrew)](/people/andrew-mitchell)

https://github.com/jayniz/resque-loner && https://github.com/quirkey/resque-status

Struggling to get access to individual jobs on your rescue queue? Today I tried to get access to my jobs to make sure that I wasn't adding lots of duplicates to my queue needlessly.  After tearing hair out trying to search through my queues I found these gems (excuse the pun). Resque loner does some magic which stops duplicates being added while Resque status gives you access to the status of individual jobs. Awesome!

The so-called 'PHP rant' did the rounds in the blogosphere last April.  Here's one person hating on MySQL. Hating hard. If you can see past the vitriol, many of the points are valid and are worthy of discussion.

## IPv6 exhaustion? - [(Matt P)](/people/matt-peperell)

http://samsclass.info/ipv6/exhaustion.htm

IPv4 address space exhaustion is relatively well understood.  What's less well known and tracked is the exhaustion of IPv6 address space.  Until now, that is!
