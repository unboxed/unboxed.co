A podcast focused on interesting people and the innovative ways they achieve success. Very suitable format for 20-40min commutes, interesting interviewees, no useless chatter.

## Track of the Week - [Carmen B](/people/carmen-brion)

It was hard to choose one, it's so many I love, but I decided to go for one of my favourite [Foo Fighter's songs 'Monkey Wench'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7rCNiiNPxA).

This is my second favourite song in [The Colour and The Shape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Colour_and_the_Shape). It just lift my spirits every time.
