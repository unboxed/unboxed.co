### The Cucumbers Strike Back! (Jolyon) ###

Good to see the cucumberistas [fighting back](http://www.livestream.com/pivotallabs/video?clipId=pla_d3e8de30-f50f-47c9-aeaa-fc350e11d605).

### Rails 4 Update! (Murray) ###

No word as yet on the unbelievably complex OR operator.

### It take all sorts! (Matt P) ###

As developers,  sorting data is frequently an integral part of our work. Rails hides the implementation away, so it's rare that we need to care about the internals. But what if we're curious and do care?

Here's a link from Hungary, but no Hungarian language needed. It's a traditional dance video designed to demonstrate the Quick Sort algorithm.

If you're curious to see other sorting algorithms be visualised then the related videos should sate your appetite. For those who wonder, the algorithm used internally by Ruby is the Heap sort. Sadly that group haven't danced that one yet.

# And finally… #

For the geek who already has the latest tech, I'm here to tell you, you haven't! while browsing the web a couple of days ago I stumbled across what I would like Santa Claus to bring me this Christmas!

Kuratas is the first  fully functioning gigantic boardable robot and has brought my childhood dream of owning my own Gundam just one step closer!!!
