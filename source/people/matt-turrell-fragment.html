      <p>My whole career has been in software, and I love it when a system goes live, making a positive impact on the lives and work of its users.</p>

<p>Scrum first appeared on my radar in 2010 and changed the way I think about software delivery forever. Then in 2012 I read The Lean Startup, which cemented my change in thinking.</p>

<p>I’m over the moon to have cast-off the role of a traditional project manager and joined Unboxed as a Scrum Master, to work with exceptional people and deliver exciting projects.</p>

<p>When I’m not working, I can often be found with a camera in-hand and am always up for a conversation about photography.</p>
