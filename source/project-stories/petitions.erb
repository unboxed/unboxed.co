petition_process:
  title: "A voice for the public"
  content: "Petitions is an online government platform, enabling members of the public to create or sign petitions that ask for a change to the law or to government policy. Those that receive 10,000 signatures get a response from the government, and 100,000+ signatures are considered for debate in Parliament. Following a report on improving public engagement in politics, we partnered with Government Digital Service (GDS) to relaunch this public service to meet a new public demand."

new_requirements:
  title: "Major new requirements for dated platform"
  content: "New requirements emerged for the old e-Petitions system, such as moving towards centralised administration for the Petitions Select committee. In order to meet these new user needs, the user journey had to be remapped and the platform redesigned and rebuilt. From previously partnering with GDS on the original e-Petitions in 2011, our team knew the drill, and the project kicked off within a matter of days."

mvp_quote:
  quote: "A strong focus on minimum viability and always having a shippable product, allowed our team to start delivering from day one with confidence we’d be ready, despite an emerging set of needs and an unclear launch date."
  source: "Pete Herlihy, Product Owner, GDS"

tech_spec:
  title: "System powered by open source Ruby on Rails application"
  content: "The team worked to full GDS practices, with design taking a mobile-first approach and the UX streamlined to create a simple user flow. The system was built to handle a high request of daily email sends (up to 150,000 during most days, rising to 500,000+ during busy times, hitting a peak of 1,000,000+), and scaled to meet the high demand of petitions with a large public following."

Since the launch, 9,443,708 signatures have been collected across 3,215 petitions. 120 of these petitions have been given a response, and 22 debated in the House of Commons."
