introduction:
  title: "Digital healthcare innovation"
  content: "SH:24 asked Unboxed to help them develop an online STI testing service. The vision was that a self service testing kit, ordered online could tackle long queues at inaccessible sexual health centres and dramatically increase public access to sexual health service."

statistics_title: "SH:24 in numbers"
statistics:
  - "8 weeks to successful prototype"
  - "100+ users involved in design"
  - "16 weeks from inception to NHS approved service"
  - "1,300 test kits ordered in first 8 weeks"
  - "95% starting an order online, complete it"

launch:
  title: "Live service launched in 16 weeks"
  content: "After only eight weeks, a user was able to order and complete an STI test at home without any clinical support. Another eight weeks later, a live service was launched to the public. This project is paving the way for transformation of other NHS services that are currently delivered face to face, in clinics."

  quote: "From the moment we met Unboxed, we felt they understood our approach and had a robust process for exploration and delivery."

service:
  title: "A new physical service with a digital core"
  content: "Whilst the digital elements formed a critical part of the service, we took great care to ensure that the experience of the physical product was equally as effective. The packaging and instructions, supporting information and messaging went through numerous iterations – for example the home blood sampling process changed radically and the instructions were tested and recreated several times."

learning:
  title: "'Moving in' next door to users and partners"
  content: "Our \"war-room\" close to the clinics gave us direct access to the service users and our clinical partners. From the earliest sketches, through prototypes and models, to the final production code and kits, we were able to validate our thinking on a daily basis with real users."

stakeholder_trust:
  title: "Building trust amongst stakeholders"
  content: "Many different stakeholders had high hopes or deep concerns about the outcome of this mould-breaking project. So we held regular open workshops to establish enough trust to move fast. We identified the most significant issues first - patient record security and service quality – and directly addressed these immediately."
