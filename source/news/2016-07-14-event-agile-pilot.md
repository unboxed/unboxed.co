Complex portfolios of digital products can stall in development. It’s a fact of life. The vision gets clouded, deployment slows down, your team becomes demotivated and progress halts. You’ve stopped delivering. (Or even worse, you can’t quite seem to get your ducks in a row and you’re having trouble kick-starting your new project).<br/>

Then comes the big question: <i>“What does it take to gain momentum?”</i>.<br/>
