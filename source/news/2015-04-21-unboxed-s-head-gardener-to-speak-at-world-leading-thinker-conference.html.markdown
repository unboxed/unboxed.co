<p>Unboxed Consulting&#39;s Head Gardener, <a href="../people#claire-kemp">Claire Kemp</a>, has been confirmed to speak at this year’s TEDx SevenMileBeach conference in the Cayman Islands.<br/></p>

<p>The conference, now in it&#39;s second year, will bring together 100 delegates, from all around the globe, for one day of exclusive talks on 10th June 2015. Claire will take to the stage to share her experiences with a selection of storytellers and visionaries from around the world.<br/></p>

<p><i>“The conference theme is: ‘The Life of an Idea: Plant. Nourish. Harvest.’ my favourite analogy for the work I have chosen as People Gardener. I’m really looking forward to delivering ‘Climate change boosts growth of ideas that transform the world’. </p>

<p>My talk is based on how the world of work has changed. Ideating is what enables businesses to solve problems in new and innovative ways and there is a need to cultivate workspaces for Knowledge Workers who &quot;think for a living&quot;. Organisations need to adjust the climate to that in which the best talent can grow rather than expecting individuals to complete an obstacle course, aligning themselves with the way businesses expect them to behave.”</i><br/></p>
