<p>Unboxed Consulting has just completed a web integration project for Channel 5, which makes the new series of Celebrity Big Brother even more interactive and accessible through Channel5.com.&nbsp; Completed in only seven weeks, on time and on budget, the new content integrates seamlessly with the Channel5.com homepage, provides an exclusive section for Celebrity Big Brother content, and for the first time introduces online eviction voting via Facebook.</p>

<p>This project was successfully developed by Unboxed&rsquo;s Cape Town team who worked with Channel 5&rsquo;s designer and product owner using Agile development methodologies. The Agile approach ensured that working as a distributed team was not a hindrance by using daily stand up meetings, a regular &ldquo;show &amp; tell&rdquo; as the software developed, and retrospective discussions.&nbsp; Online planning tools meant that all members of the team, including Channel 5&rsquo;s product owner, could see the status of project elements with total transparency.</p>

<p>Celebrity Big Brother fans can now see more content then ever before for up-to-the-minute gossip, exclusive videos, photos and information about the housemates. They can also play the ultimate &lsquo;big brother&rsquo; by casting their votes for the first time using Facebook and mobile. As Big Brother says &ndash; you decide!
