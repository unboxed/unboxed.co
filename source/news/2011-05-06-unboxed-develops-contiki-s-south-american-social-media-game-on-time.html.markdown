<p>Contiki, the travel company for 18 &ndash; 35s has once again teamed up with Unboxed Consulting to launch their new social media game <a href="http://www.pinmeifyoucan.com">Pinmeifyoucan</a>. This game is a creative way to highlight Contiki&rsquo;s new South American holidays and Unboxed delivered within very tight deadlines.&nbsp; With the tours launching, Unboxed had only 5 weeks from getting the designs to launching the site on time. Contiki&rsquo;s global web team commented that &lsquo;things went off without any major hitches on launch day &ndash; this is testament to Unboxed&rsquo;s patience and the great job the guys did in getting this built and rolled out.&rsquo; &nbsp;Pinmeifyoucan has already received positive comment from <a href="http://www.nileguide.com/blog/2011/05/09/travel-trivia-the-new-“voting”-contest/">nileguide.com</a>&nbsp;and for more information contact <a href="../people/alan-thomas">Alan Thomas</a>.</p>
