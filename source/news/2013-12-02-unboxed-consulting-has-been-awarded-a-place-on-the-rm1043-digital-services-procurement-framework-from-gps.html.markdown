<p>Unboxed Consulting has been awarded a place on the <b>RM1043 Digital Services</b> Procurement Framework from the Government Procurement Service (GPS). Managing Director, Steve Lennon says: &quot;We are delighted to be part of this latest central government digital service initiative designed to simplify procurement of powerful technology solutions delivered using Agile methods.&quot;</p>

<p>Unboxed Consulting is one of the leading Agile thinkers and partners to central government and Government Digital Service (GDS). In the last two years, successful projects have included the development of the <a href="http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/">epetitions</a> site in 5 weeks and for £80,000 and Agile programmes at <a href="http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/">Land Registry</a>, <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/">HMRC</a> and the <a href="http://www.education.gov.uk/">Department of Education</a>.</p>
