    I believe building software is the most complex endeavor humans have set themselves to do. At Unboxed I get to do it with smart people who really value working in an Agile manner. And this is all a lot more fun than the world of financial risk management where I started my career.

    I have grown up with Unboxed Consulting where we have learned to embrace change that is defined by the user. I swapped working in the PMO for working as a part of a team as a Scrum Master and then as a Tester. I pivoted again, changing focus from the end user of digital products to concentrate on the people who are involved in delighting end users. Being a "Gardener" is my analogy for cultivating an environment in which talent can thrive and great ideas grow into products that add more colour to life.

    There’s only so much a developer can do on their own, even when supplied with a bottomless cup of Darjeeling and all the Scottish indie-pop their ears desire. At least, that’s what I’ve learned in my years as a web developer and why I joined Unboxed Consulting. It’s a great team of smart people with an amazing focus on agile development processes and I'm glad to be a part of it.

    I'm a huge geek, with an overly-keen eye for detail, a truly terrible taste in music and a severely lacking knowledge of films. I found my love for development around the age of 16 and since progressed to study Software Engineering at Imperial College, London. I started as an intern at Unboxed in the third year of my degree, and found it so much more rewarding than being at Uni!

    Ten years ago I started my first job - shoring up a failing project in a failing dot com. Ever since then I've been helping people with projects that are in trouble, and in doing so, learnt a lot about agile methods and how they can help a struggling project. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find us, maybe you can hire... unboxed

    I have been around a long time, having now spent nigh on thirty years working on projects. Starting first as a developer using COBOL(!), moving onto Visual Basic and Forte. After a few years I moved into more analytical, people management and project management roles, so have seen a lot of issues that projects face. Having started work in a truly waterfall manner it is refreshing to now be part of a company that not only talks about Agile but does it, properly.
    I enjoy running and socialising - and find that the two go well together!

    Coming with over 7 years working in the broadcast industry, I had the ability to work in a multitude of technical roles. What I enjoyed the most was scripting (bash, VBScript, Perl) automating business processes, reporting with SQL, and well bullying developers with bugs that should never have been!
    In the end, understanding my strengths I pursued testing with the aim of automation as my priority.

In my free time I love Xbox, graphic novels and harassing my better half. This is me.

    I’m passionate about solving problems for people. These problems can come in a huge variety of forms - from a business-wide structural improvement, through to a micro-optimisation on a web form that makes a user happy. I enjoy trying to come up with solutions to these problems in new and novel ways. Having coded in Perl for longer than I care to admit, I’m truly happy to be in the Ruby, Agile, and Lean-thinking world. Right now I’m focussed on implementing DevOps principles at Unboxed.

    I began by studying rocks and found my love of code later. I’ve moved from the world of scientific desktop software to web development using open source. My goal is to be the best developer I can be and for me this means being part of an active and stimulating community, something that Unboxed and the web development community as a whole provides in spades.
    Away from a desk, I enjoy running, climbing and cooking tasty grub (or at least attempts at these)

    I cut my teeth on a massive Open Source roll out in South Africa, with a split focus between development and dev-ops. It became obvious that I enjoyed the development side far more. So here I am now, at Unboxed, to focus my time on energy on what I enjoy the most.
    In my off time I enjoy the outdoors, having a braai, watching documentaries and finding new music.
