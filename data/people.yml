    I founded and run Unboxed Consulting, an Agile Enterprise Ruby on Rails System Integrator. I enjoy stimulating ideas, shaping the company and looking for ways to improve ourselves. I am also interested in Lean Startup and Startup Weekends.
    In my spare time I am setting up a charity for pupils to attend Hilton College.
    I was named 'Best Agile Coach or Mentor (Process)' at the 2014 UK Agile Awards.

    As a contributor to Ruby on Rails since 2007 and a core team member since 2012 I really enjoy helping people with their Rails problems and working at Unboxed gives me a great opportunity to do that, both with the great developers we have here and with our clients.
    I also like to help to the new generation of Rails programmers and as part of that I mentor students from across the world as part of the Facebook OpenAcademy and Google Summer of Code programs.

    I have been around a long time, having now spent nigh on thirty years working on projects. Starting first as a developer using COBOL(!), moving onto Visual Basic and Forte. After a few years I moved into more analytical, people management and project management roles, so have seen a lot of issues that projects face. Having started work in a truly waterfall manner it is refreshing to now be part of a company that not only talks about Agile but does it, properly.
    I enjoy running and socialising - and find that the two go well together!

    I have grown up with Unboxed Consulting where we have learned to embrace change that is defined by the user. I swapped working in the PMO for working as a part of a team as a Scrum Master and then as a Tester. I pivoted again, changing focus from the end user of digital products to concentrate on the people who are involved in delighting end users. Being a "Gardener" is my analogy for cultivating an environment in which talent can thrive and great ideas grow into products that add more colour to life.

    There’s only so much a developer can do on their own, even when supplied with a bottomless cup of Darjeeling and all the Scottish indie-pop their ears desire. At least, that’s what I’ve learned in my years as a web developer and why I joined Unboxed Consulting. It’s a great team of smart people with an amazing focus on agile development processes and I'm glad to be a part of it.

    My first foray into programming took place during my Computer Animation degree almost 15 years ago, writing simple graphics programs with C/C++ and OpenGL.
    However I was briefly (for about 10 years) led astray by the power of pretty pictures and thus became a technical artist, working on various Hollywood blockbusters.
    During this time I did have some opportunities to play with Python, which eventually lured me back into the world of programming.
    In 2013 I took the dive and completed a Masters in Computer Science at Imperial College, and joined Unboxed shortly thereafter.
    I love that Unboxed gives me the opportunity to work on varied, high-profile projects in a supportive Agile environment that focuses on developing the right things in the right way.
